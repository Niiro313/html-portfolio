<h1>Best Movies According to Saul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of a spotless mind</h3>
<p>I believe it's one of the most beautiful and heart breaking stories ever imagined with a great sci-fi twist</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>It's a fable wrapped in a very deep and complicated sci-fi story about the future of humanity and the struggles between man, machine and artificial intelligence</p>
<h3>Back to the future 2</h3>
Actually this one is mostly because of the nostalgia though it is a fun film and the second part of an awesome trilogy about time travel
